# Title Generator 
## Introduction
I made a csv file that contains the best data science articles from various tags that I scraped using Parsehub on the Medium.com website. The csv file has information on the title of the article, tags used, publication, claps received, number of responses etc. This dataset is available on Kaggle and is called [Medium-Search-Dataset](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Faristotle609%2Fmediumsearchdataset).

## The Problem
Our task is to find the coefficients of each equation. To speed up the training time we'll be using a pre-trained neural network Resnet-50. Since this is a regression problem I will be altering the model to better suit our data.

## The Process
My task is to make a text generator to generate coherent Article Titles. I will be using the transformers library for pre-processing and model building I will then finetune the model using PyTorch Lightning.
